## Python Notebook for Neural Network

All files end in .ipynb are Python notebook files. These files are needed to build the neural network based power flow model. Additional python libraries are required to run these notebook files: pytorch, numpy, matplotlib, csv.

## Datasets (needs to download separately):
All data files are stored in .csv format. The datat set contains the data used for training Neural Network for different IEEE systems.
The datasets are available on Figshare. The link is as follows:

All data files are stored in .csv format. The datat set contains training data for different IEEE systems. Using data_x_pf_9 as an example, each column is a data sample. 
* The first 9 rows are active power (1-9). 
* The second 9 rows are reactive power(10-18). 
* The third 9 rows are initial voltage (19-27).


## MATLAB files to generate data

If you want to create your own data set, the .m files will generate your own training data set. MATLAB software and Matpower toolbox are needed in order to run these files.
